1. comp gets data from form to comp's field (model obj); //see reactive-forms.html
        2.on submit calls service's login(this.model); //see http.ts

3. service returns http post req(API's url, model);
        4. intercepts resp as {token, user} from API, if exists -> to local storage 'token', 'user';
        5. decodes token -> to field;
        6. user -> to field;

7. comp receives http resp from service and subscribes to it -> success mes or error mess, if success -> redirects to els; //see alertify.ts
