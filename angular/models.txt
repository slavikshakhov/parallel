1. create (user.ts):

        import { Photo } from './photo';

        export interface User {
        id: number;
        username: string;
        created: Date;
        lastActive: any;
        interests?: string;
        photos?: Photo[];
        }
2. using model in comp's field to collect data from form:
    user: User;  //reactive form
    model: any = {};  //template form
3. using model in comp-service as arg (user: User) vs (model: any)
